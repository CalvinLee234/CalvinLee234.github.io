   <h2>The Chicken and the Sauce</h2>
   <p> The Chicken is just not good. If you've ever had the chicken without the sauce, you would see exactly what I mean. To add on to that, the prices are similar in range to chick-fil-a without any of the offerings that chick-fil-a gives you. Chick-fil-a has some of the most unique chicken out there with a plethora of sauce options. On the other hand, Canes tastes like school cafeteria chicken with only one sauce to offer. Canes chicken specializes in only chicken but fails in this specialization by offering dry, bland, school cafeteria-esque, food. Canes chickne not only tastes worse than chick-fil a but is also much unhealthier than chick-fil-a. In fact, the link below details on multiple reasons why you shouldn't eat at Canes Chicken. Essentially, the sauce is the only thing that saves the chickne from being horrible, which is not how a resturant that specializes in chicken should be.   </p>

   <h3>The Sauce</h3>
   <p> On the upside, the sauce is actually pretty good as it hits all the savory and umami notes that a good sauce should have. However, a sauce is just a sauce and can't save what has happened to the chicken. The sauce is also easily replicated and tastes similar to many of the other "secret" sauces at places like In-N-Out.  </p>

   <h2>The Fries!</h2>
   <h3>The Fries are the worst part</h3>
   <p>The fries are definently the worst part of Canes Chicken.I can think of no travesty greater than a soggy, sad, limp fry. Unfortunately, this is exactly what the fries are. There isn't really much to say about these fries as they taste like or worse than frozen fries you could find at your local grocery store. If you compare to resturants like Chick-Fil-A, the fries there are much crispier and are unique due to their waffle shape. </p>
